# Emotion Representation Mapping: COLING 2018

## Introduction
See README of parent folder for a higher-level overview.

## Installation
1. Costumize the paths in `EmoMap/coling18/framework/constants.py`
2. Set up the `conda` environment stored in `EmoMap/coling18/environment.yml`
3. Navigate into `EmoMap/coling18/` and run `source activate.src`. This will activate the `conda` environment and sets a required environment variable.
4. Congratulations! You're set-up to run any part of the codebase. Alternativly do `sh run_all.sh` to re-run everthing. Note that the results may be slighty off from the ones reported in the paper, since making the code completely deterministic is difficult due to multi-threading.
